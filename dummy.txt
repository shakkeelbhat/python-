remember those " @entity1 " books ? you know , the ones featuring a bespectacled , beanstalky character dressed in a red - and - white striped shirt -- and hiding in massive crowds			0
objective : find him , turn page			0
a fascinating online project is using that same spot - that - one - thing construct to try to save rhinos and other wildlife from poaching at a wildlife reserve in @entity14			1
part of the @entity18 effort , the @entity14 project gathered 500 volunteers -- " digital rangers , " in the group 's parlance -- over the weekend to sift through aerial photos looking for wildlife			1
the goal was to survey more land more quickly than on - the - ground rangers could , and to consequently protect rhinos and the like from poaching or other threats			1
the online army of volunteers , which included people from dozens of countries , surveyed more than 25,000 aerial photos shot by drones from friday to sunday , according to the group 's website			1
they circled wildlife they found , and uploaded their findings			2
volunteers could spend as much or as little time as they wanted			0
" it is challenging but a really fun challenge , " @entity46 , director of social innovation at the @entity48 , which was behind the project , wrote in an email to me			1
" ( it ) makes me feel like a digital @entity55 or @entity56			1
" so , pick your metaphor : @entity59 , @entity55 or @entity56			1
it 's cool no matter how you describe it			2
the effort grows out of @entity46 's work with @entity64 and others to help citizens map and analyze data in response to natural disasters , like the 2010 @entity71 earthquake			1
it also builds on the citizen science movement , which seeks to involve everyday people in real scientific endeavors , from analyzing whale songs to mapping the structure of proteins			0
i love these projects -- not just for their do - gooder potential , but also because they encourage people to get involved in the news , and to learn something new about the world			0
as @entity46 put it : " hopefully now people know where @entity14 is on the map ! " ( @entity91 , by the way , northwest of @entity87 and south of @entity89 )			1
i also reported on the illegal wildlife trade in @entity96 earlier this year for @entity97 's @entity99 project , so the project hit a chord with me for that reason , too			1
the black market trade in wildlife is massive -- $ 5 billion to $ 20 billion per year , according to @entity105			2
rhinos are in particular trouble lately			2
it 's a worthy issue and , as @entity46 explained , an important test of a " micro-tasking " platform that could be used to tackle other crises , including disaster response			1
i asked @entity46 to answer a few questions about the @entity14 wildlife project over email			1
the following is a copy - paste version of that conversation , edited for length and clarity : @entity122 : â€‹ â€‹ what 's the name of the project and who 's behind it ? @entity46 : it 's called @entity18 , a joint initiative between the @entity48 and the @entity130 's @entity129 ( @entity129 )			1
in terms of the @entity134 / @entity14 deployment , this is a joint collaboration with the @entity48 , @entity135 , @entity136 , @entity137 , and @entity138 de @entity139			1
@entity122 : how did it come about ? @entity46 : as a digital humanitarian response to @entity142 in the @entity143 2012			1
we had experimented with micro-tasking to analyze pictures posted on @entity146 to support the @entity130 's @entity129 ' rapid damage assessment efforts			2
after this largely successful response , @entity129 called me up and asked me if i 'd be ready to replicate this effort ( micro-tasking ) in future disasters			2
more recently , given the increasing use of unmanned aerial vehicles ( @entity155 , or drones ) in humanitarian response , we decided to develop the @entity158			2
the purpose of the @entity158 is to crowdsource the analysis of aerial imagery for disaster response			0
the @entity48 wanted to test the new @entity158 -- but not in the middle of a disaster			0
given our existing collaboration with @entity135 ( a group aiming to help citizens map the word with drones ) , i approached the latter and offered to help their partners in @entity14 analyze their aerial imagery			1
this would help the rangers assess whether crowdsourcing could support their future wildlife monitoring and protection work while helping us test the @entity158 in a nondisaster situation			2
@entity122 : the @entity18 said over the weekend that about 500 " digital rangers " participated in this project			1
who are they -- what sorts of day jobs do they have , etc ? @entity46 : it 's hard to say since many do n't sign in to volunteer but , anecdotally , a combination of digital humanitarian volunteers and individuals who are interested in wildlife protection , from all ages and walks of life			1
i know that several @entity196 schools are involved , since several teachers got in touch with me earlier			0
here 's a note i got from a woman who is participating : " i am very grateful and looking forward to being even a small part of @entity18			2
i donate to @entity202 and also make purchases that benefit conservation of land and the animals that habitate them , including purchases of the book ' @entity210 , ' etc. it was always my dream to go to @entity87 to help the wildlife in any way i could , but realistically that is not possible for most			2
so thank you so much for helping me to participate in this program , and giving us , the public , an opportunity to help , hopefully this can be another step towards stopping the poachers			0
" @entity122 : what 's the end goal ? or what big questions are you hoping will be answered ? @entity46 : the big questions we 're hoping to answer : can the crowd accurately identify and trace features of interest in high resolution aerial imagery captured by ( drones ) ? is the @entity158 ready for prime time ( i.e. a deployment during a disaster ) ? are the resulting traces of high quality enough to develop machine learning classifiers to potentially semi-automate the identification of features in future deployments ? @entity122 : where do the images come from - and who will analyze the findings ? @entity46 : the images come from @entity135			1
we will analyze the results together with the rangers at @entity136			0
@entity122 : this seems like adult " @entity1 " to me -- but , i guess , with a purpose ? @entity46 : yes , " @entity1 " with a purpose			1
incidentally , one of our next pilots will likely be later this year in the @entity143			0
a local @entity155 partner , called @entity260 , is doing some great work around the use of @entity155 for disaster response			0
after major typhoons in the @entity143 , one important element of disaster damage assessment is to determine how many coconut trees have been uprooted / destroyed since this impacts local livelihoods and food security			0
to date , @entity260 has had to manually count destroyed coconut trees in the many aerial pictures they take			0
so what we want to do is to upload these images to the @entity158 and launch a similar challenge to determine whether the crowd is able to accurately identify said coconut trees			0
we 're also interested to explore whether these resulting traces can be used to create a machine learning classifier for destroyed coconut trees			0
in general , one of the main use cases for the @entity158 is infrastructure damage assessment			0
that said , given the interest around the @entity14 challenge , it 's clear that our @entity289 ( and the other @entity290 ) could be used for applications beyond disaster response			1
in fact , an archaeologist who uses @entity155 as part of his work got in touch to ask about potentially using the @entity158 and crowdsourcing as part of his archaeology projects			0
we 're psyched about all the other possible applications and keen to explore these and partner with others			0
this is very much in line with the mandate and focus of the social innovation program that i direct at the @entity48			0
@entity122 : have you gone digital game hunting yourself ? is it hard ? @entity46 : yes i have ( although i would n't use the word hunting )			1
it is challenging but a really fun challenge -- makes me feel like a digital @entity55 or @entity56			1
there are all those computing games for kids ( mostly ) that ask players to find certain hidden objects in made - up pictures			2
it 's all fictitious but this ( wildlife challenge ) is real , so you can have fun while doing something meaningful and learning a few things in the process			2
hopefully , now , people know where @entity14 is on the map ! and have learned a few things about wildlife issues in the country			1
@entity122 : tell me how this effort fits into the bigger picture - both in terms of the crowdsourcing movement and environmental science ? @entity46 : i 've come into this from the digital humanitarian side of things but there are obviously important overlaps with citizen science , which is why i 've spent quite a bit of time learning from the pros in citizen science , like @entity354			1
( i 'm collaborating with them on this other project , by the way , and we 're hoping to pilot the initiative very soon )			2
@entity354 is really great for large - scale citizen science deployments			0
in our case , @entity18 seeks to support the " long tail " of citizen science or digital - humanitarian projects , i.e. those projects which simply do n't require hundreds of thousands of volunteers but rather a few hundred to a few thousand			0
that 's where we fit in the bigger picture			0
@entity122 : is this new ? or how does it push things forward ? @entity46 : crowdsourcing the analysis of aerial imagery for wildlife protection is certainly new			1
i have n't heard of any other project like this			0
but what @entity18 really pushes forward is how easy it is to become a digital humanitarian or a digital ranger , for that matter			0
the clickers are specifically designed so that anyone can volunteer without prior experience or special skills			0
with @entity18 , we 're looking to democratize the digital humanitarian experience .			0
